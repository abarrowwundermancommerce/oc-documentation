### New Features
- The OrderCloud Portal now supports single-sign-on with Sitecore Cloud identities. If you have a Sitecore Cloud account and an OrderCloud Portal account, you can link the two under _OrderCloud Portal > Settings >Authentication > Sitecore Cloud_.

>This is the initial step of a multi-phased process to formally integrate OrderCloud Portal and Sitecore Cloud. More information on Sitecore Cloud will be shared in the weeks ahead.
