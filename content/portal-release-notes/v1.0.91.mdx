### New Features
- The OrderCloud Portal now supports single sign-on with [Sitecore Cloud](https://portal.sitecorecloud.io/) identities. This is the first step of a multi-phased process aimed at formally integrating the OrderCloud Portal with Sitecore Cloud.

>It is worth noting that Sitecore Cloud is a new system and does not include all Sitecore users. If you already have a Sitecore Cloud account and an OrderCloud Portal account, you can link the two under OrderCloud Portal > Settings > Authentication > Sitecore Cloud.
