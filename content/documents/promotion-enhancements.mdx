### Summary
- new property `AutoApply`, default `false`
- new property `Active`, default `true`
- new optional property `Priority`
- new endpoints
    - `v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/eligiblepromotions`
    - `v1/cart/eligiblepromotions`
    - `v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/applypromotions`
    - `v1/cart/applypromotions`

### Priority
New Property `Priority`, default `false`

The new `Priority` property on Promotions can be used to control the order in which promotions are applied when calling `v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/applypromotions` / `v1/cart/applypromotions`. There are no rules around the sequencing of `Priority` values.

### Active
New property `Active`, default `true`

Promotions where `Active = false` will not be evaluated for either the `.../applypromotions` or `.../eligiblepromotions` endpoints, and will never be returned from `v1/me/promotions`. Designating a promotion `Active = false` effectively “deletes” the promotion, without deleting the promotion record from your marketplace. A newly deactivated promotion will also be removed from any Unsubmitted orders immediately following deactivation. The promotion data will remain accessible from the administrative endpoints, making for a good historical record, or for possible reactivation in the future. 

Tip: If you delete a promotion from your marketplace, any submitted orders that contain an `OrderPromotion` with `PromotionID` equal to the newly deleted promotion, the `PromotionID` field on the `OrderPromotion` will be nulled out. Utilizing the new `Active` property, the `PromotionID` will maintain it’s value.

### Auto Apply
New property `AutoApply`, default `false`

New endpoints:
`v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/applypromotions`
`v1/cart/applypromotions`

This new property and endpoints enable users to designate promotions as AutoApply, and set varying numeric Priority values which dictate the order in which promotions are automatically applied. When you have a number of promotions designated as `AutoApply`, whenever you want to attempt to apply these promotions to an order, you call the new respective endpoint above. This will fetch all eligible promotions where `AutoApply = true`, sorted by `Priority` and attempt to apply them to the order one by one. Promotions where `Priority = null` will be evaluated last. The Order model is then returned from this call, enabling the developer to display the new `PromotionDiscount` in the UI. The maximum number of promotions that will be applied to an order in a single API call is 100.

### Eligible Promotions
New endpoints:
`v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/eligiblepromotions`
`v1/cart/eligiblepromotions`

The new endpoints enable listing eligible promotions for an order. This supports feature builds such as displaying eligible promo codes to the buyer user during checkout, and many other UI driven promotion-based enhancements.
