## Prerequisites
To make use of the [Product Collections](/knowledge-base/product-collections) resource, we need:
- An active buyer user
- Fully orderable products visible to the buyer user

## Assumptions
- We have a product with an ID of `enterprise-product-id` that is orderable and visible to our buyer user.
- We end up with a product that had been added to our Wishlist that we want to remove, with an ID of `basic-product-id`.

## Create a new Product Collection to represent our Wishlist
The first thing we need to do, is create the Product Collection itself.  Let's name it "Wishlist" giving it a self-descriptive ID.
<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `POST https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/productcollections HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n
{
  "ID": "wishlist",
  "Name": "Wishlist",
}`,
javascript: `import { Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.CreateProductCollection({
  ID: "wishlist",
  Name: "Wishlist",
})
.then((productCollection) => {
    console.log(productCollection);
})
.catch((ex) => console.log(ex));
`,
typescript: `import { Me, OrderCloudError, ProductCollection } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.CreateProductCollection({
  ID: "wishlist",
  Name: "Wishlist",
})
.then((productCollection: ProductCollection) => {
  console.log(productCollection);
})
.catch((ex: OrderCloudError) => console.log(ex));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK; \n
var productCollection = new ProductCollection
{
    ID = "wishlist",
    Name = "Wishlist",
};
try {
  ProductCollection response = await Me.CreateProductCollection(data);
  Console.WriteLine(response)
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
  Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
`
}}
/>

## Add a product to our Wishlist
Adding an entry to our Wishlist Product Collection is as easy as calling `PUT /me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/{productID}` with our Product Collection ID and the product ID we want to add to our collection. If successful, our call should return a `204 No Content` response.
<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `PUT https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/productcollections/wishlist/enterprise-product-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`,
javascript: `import { Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.CreateProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "enterprise-product-id")
.then(() => {
    console.log("Successfully added a product to your wishlist!");
})
.catch((ex) => console.log(ex));
`,
typescript: `import { Me, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.CreateProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "enterprise-product-id")
.then(() => {
  console.log("Successfully added a product to your wishlist!");
})
.catch((ex: OrderCloudError) => console.log(ex));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK; \n
try {
  await Me.CreateProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "enterprise-product-id");
  Console.WriteLine("Successfully added a product to your wishlist!")
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
  Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
`
}}
/>

## Remove a product from our Wishlist
Remember that product from our [assumptions](/knowledge-base/building-wishlist-using-product-collections#assumptions) that we want to remove from our Wishlist? Let's make the call to remove the product.
<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `DELETE https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/productcollections/wishlist/basic-product-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`,
javascript: `import { Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.DeleteProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "basic-product-id")
.then(() => {
    console.log("Successfully removed a product from your wishlist.");
})
.catch((ex) => console.log(ex));
`,
typescript: `import { Me, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.DeleteProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "basic-product-id")
.then(() => {
  console.log("Successfully removed a product from your wishlist.");
})
.catch((ex: OrderCloudError) => console.log(ex));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK; \n
try {
  await Me.DeleteProductCollectionEntry("wishlist", "basic-product-id");
  Console.WriteLine("Successfully removed a product from your wishlist.")
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
  Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
`
}}
/>

## List products in our Wishlist
Now that we have our Wishlist Product Collection, and have added a product to it, let's list out the products in our Product Collection to see our Wishlist in action. We should see a list page containing one product (`enterprise-product-id`) returned from the list call.
<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/productcollections/wishlist/products HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`,
javascript: `import { Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.ListProductCollectionEntries("wishlist")
.then((wishlist) => {
    console.log(wishlist.Items);
})
.catch((ex) => console.log(ex));
`,
typescript: `import { Me, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.ListProductCollectionEntries("wishlist", "enterprise-product-id")
.then((wishlist: ListPageWithFacets<BuyerProduct>) => {
  console.log(wishlist.Items);
})
.catch((ex: OrderCloudError) => console.log(ex));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK; \n
try {
  ListPageWithFacets<BuyerProduct> response = await Me.ListProductCollectionEntries("wishlist", "enterprise-product-id");
  Console.WriteLine(response.Items)
} catch(OrderCloudException ex) {
  Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
`
}}
/>

## Implement your new Wishlist feature
That's it! It's that simple. Product Collections make building wishlist-like features for B2X commerce easy. Now that you have a basic understanding of how Product Collections work, you can take this knowledge and build a UI in your buyer application for buyer users to create and manage their wishlists.

## Considerations
This implementation is one of the many permutations of the Product Collections resource. There are many ways to utilize Product Collections and a "wishlist" feature is just one of them. A few more example features that could make use of Product Collections are "Save for later" or "Favorites".

Product Collections are:
- only usable by buyer users.
- currently only visible to the buyer user who created them.
- limited to 500 products per collection. There is no limit on the number of Product Collections a buyer user can have.
- If a buyer user adds a product to a Product Collection and visibility between the product and buyer user is revoked, the product will not be returned from `GET /me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/products`. 
If visibility is restored, the product will begin returning from the aforementioned call once again.
