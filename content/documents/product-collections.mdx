New OrderCloud resource enabling buyer users to save lists of products. This feature can be used to build features like "Save For Later" (moving products from an active `Order` to a `ProductCollection`), favorite products, or custom wish lists.

## Key Highlights
- Only products visible to the buyer user (returned from `GET me/products`) can be added to a `ProductCollection`
- `ProductCollections` have a limit of 500 products each
- There is no limit on how many `ProductCollections` an individual buyer user can create
- Currently `ProductCollections` are only visible to the buyer user who created them
   - We may expand functionality in the future to allow making lists public within a buyer organization and/or sharing lists with specific users

## New Resource: `ProductCollection`

```json
"ProductCollection": {
  "ID": "",
  "Name": "",
  "xp": {}
}
```

**Endpoints:**
- `GET v1/me/productcollections`
- `GET v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}`
- `POST v1/me/productcollections`
- `PUT v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}`
- `PATCH v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}`
- `DELETE v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}`
- `GET v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/products`
   - List products in an existing collection
   - Subject to all [product visibility requirements](/knowledge-base/product-visibility) 
- `PUT v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/{productID}`
   - Add a product to an existing collection
- `DELETE v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/{productID}`
   - Remove a product from an existing collection
